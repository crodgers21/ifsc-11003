      <p> Below is a statement from our enthusiatic transfer student Malik Thompson about his experience here at UALR and how he has transitioned into being "The Ultimate Trojan": </p>

      <blockquote> Man, UALR and their staff have been great. Having grown up here in Little Rock all my life, I've been a part of the school district here and seen just how flawed it can get. Especially with the lack of funding our educators get. And I thought maybe UALR would fall victim to the same lack of budgeting that LRSD had in finding good quality teachers and programs for the students to grow in. But I was wrong. The univeristy has some of the best professors in the world that makes my education experience truly beneficial and worthwhile! I'm even going to social events on campus which I would never do and actually connecting with people on campus. I'm really like the model Trojan transfer student. Better yet, the Ultimate Trojan!</blockquote> <!-- closing my blockquote -->
